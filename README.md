Homework Assignment #2 - Advanced CSS: Portfolio

# What did i do?

For this portfolio project I decided to use the design given to us and replicate it. This entailed using...

• media queries
• flexbox
• UI box styling.
• font-family and line-height.
• pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements
• CSS selectors to reference HTML elements in different ways.
• CSS variables to keep their code clean.
• advanced CSS styling for an enhanced UI.

# What did i need to explain?

• Explain the default styles that browsers apply to form elements.
→ Browsers have default styling that they will apply to HTML elements. This styling is meant to make minimally coded HTML pages readable.
→ Coders generally don't want these because we would prefer full control over the styling of our web pages.
• Explain why you would use a CSS reset.
→ Resetting browser default styling is the best way for coders to take full control over the page stylings they are building. We prefer setting these defaults to 0 or nothing so that we can style them from there.
• Create and explain the purpose of a wireframe.
→ In the CSS file there is a style in ':root' that can be activated to turn on the wireframing.
→ Wireframes are applied styles that allows the coder to show areas on the page and see how big they are. It is a great way to lay out a page early on in the coding process.
• Resolve a merge conflict that results from a git pull.
→ I did not run into this while building this project. I suppose I will have to force a mistake in order to resolve an issue like this.
